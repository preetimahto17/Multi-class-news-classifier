<h2> Multi-class text classification using scikit-learn </h2>
It is a web application that has been integrated using Python and Flask framework. </br>
A supervised text classification problem that uses Multinomial Gaussian Naive Baiyes training algorithm on a BBC news dataset to classify text into 5 pre-defined classes:</br>
1. Technology </br>
2. Sports </br>
3. Politics </br>
4. Business </br>
5. Entertainment </br>
And I have also used Jupyter Notebook for performing different operations like Data Exploration, Data classification etc.
